The African National Congress38, Market StreetJohannesburgJune 6, 1954Dr. W. A. HuntonSecretaryCouncil on African AffairsSuite 6, 139 West 125th StreetNew York, 27, N. Y.U.S.A.Dear Friend,Thanks for your letter of the 11th May 1954 with the enclosed resolution adopted at your Conference in support of African liberation. Please convey our deep appreciation to the Council for the continued support we are receiving. Your work is a great inspiration to the African people and other democrats in South Africa.During my tour of Europe and China I had the occasion of witnessing the effect and importance of the work carried out by your Council. There can be no doubt that it is because of the influence and power of the work done by your Council that has led to restrictions being placed on such an outstanding world figure, champion of peace and justice and world artist as Paul Robeson.I would like to mention with a view of getting your support, our growing concern at the mass murder and atrocities carried out by the British troops against innocent and defenceless Africans in Kenya. The need for an intensification of the campaign for immediate cessation [of] this war of mass annihilation and the release of the leaders of the Kenya African Union and other African leaders who are in jail and in concentration camps, as a prelude to an honest peaceful discussion between the African leaders and the imperialist Government of Great Britain.I am confident that a call by Paul Robeson and Dr. Du Bois similar to the one they sent to the people of Africa in 1952, will have a tremendous support in various parts of the world. The Kenya Committee, in December, launched a peace campaign which had a great effect on the British public and forced the British Government to attempt, though not very honest, peace negotiations. For further particulars you may communicate with them at, Kenya Committee, 86 Rochester Row, London S.W.1.Yours Fraternally,(sd.) W. M. SisuluSecretary-General
